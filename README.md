1. Validity Measures
How do the different scores interact? What should the paragraph look like? What do some of the ouputs mean?
2. WRAML
Are there two different Finger Window sentences (one for standard score and one for scaled score)? Is recognition the same for Validity Measures and WRAML? Will inputs be a range or a specific number? Is last sentence always present? What should input of 5 correlate to, as it is contained in two ranges?
3. SDMT
Will input be a specific number or range? Also, do the ranges contain typos? What should input of 1.5 correlate to, as it is contained in two ranges?
4. DKEFS
Will input be a specific number or range? What should input of 5 correlate to, as it is contained in two ranges?
5. Beery VMI
Will input be a specific number or range? What should input of 5 correlate to, as it is contained in two ranges?
6. Diagnoses
Are the options of assessment important? What is TSI Check?

How should inputs be grouped on entry?
