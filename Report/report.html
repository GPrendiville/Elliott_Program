                processing of novel, incomplete, and less conventional types of information -
                the kind of processing required for the successful performance of executive

            <p class="paragraphs"> Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s attention, concentration, and memory were assessed on the
                WRAML-2 and RAVLT. On the WRAML-2, Mr. XXXXXwas administered the
                Finger Windows subtest and his performance was in the 37th percentile. These
                results indicate average visual short-term memory. On the RAVLT, which is a
                measure of verbal learning and memory, Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s overall performance on the
                Trial I - V Total score was in the 14th percentile. Additionally, his Delayed Recall
                score was in the 38th percentile and his Recognition score was in the 27th percentile.
                Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s poor results indicate problems with short-term memory and verbal
                learning.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraphs"> Mr. XXXXXwas administered the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) which is
                a measure for screening cerebral dysfunction, including attention, perceptual speed,
                motor speed, and visual scanning. Various standard deviation values have been
                examined as possible cutoff points for optimally distinguishing between normal adults
                and adults with brain dysfunction. Based on this criteria, Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s performance
                was between 1.5 and 2.0 standard deviations below the mean indicating that his
                performance is in the moderately range.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraphs"> Mr. XXXXXwas administered the Verbal Fluency and Color-Word Interference
                tests from the D-KEFS. On the Verbal Fluency Test, the Letter Fluency task is a
                means of evaluating the fluency with which the examinee can generate lexical items
                while simultaneously observing several rules or restrictions. The examinee must
                simultaneously monitor his or her own responses while generating words as quickly as
                possible. Higher-level functions tapped by this task include initiation, simultaneous
                processing, systematic retrieval of phonemically similar lexical items, and speed of
                processing. Performance on this task also depends on several fundamental
                cognitive components, including vocabulary knowledge, spelling ability, and
                attention. Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s performance on this subtest was in the 1st percentile.
                Category Fluency requires the examinee to retrieve multiple words from a
                high-frequency semantic category. If semantic knowledge is intact, then the retrieval
                of words from an overlearned semantic category usually requires less effort than
                does the retrieval of words that start with a particular sound, which usually
                requires more effortful processing due, in large part, to the novelty of the
                endeavor. Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s performance on this subtest was in the 2nd percentile.
                Finally, the Category Switching task simultaneously requires rapid retrieval

                from semantic knowledge and cognitive flexibility in shifting between two
                semantic categories. Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s performance on this subtest was in the 9th
                percentile.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraphs"> On the Color-Word Interference test, the Color Naming condition is a test
                of the speed with which an examinee can name high-frequency, repeating
                stimuli (i.e., color patches). As such, performance on this condition serves at
                least two purposes. First and foremost, this condition provides a baseline
                measure for parceling out basic naming skills from the higher-level functions of
                verbal inhibition and switching. Second, it serves as a separate measure of a
                fundamental linguistic skill, namely, speed of naming. Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s performance
                on this subtest was below the 1st percentile. The Word Reading task is a
                means of evaluating the examinee&#8217;s ability to read high-frequency, repeating
                words as quickly as possible. As with Color Naming, this condition can serve
                as a baseline measure for purposes of parceling out basic reading speed,
                and<br class="newline" />as a separate measure of the fundamental linguistic skill of speed of reading.
                Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s performance on this subtest was below the 1st percentile. The time taken
                to complete the Inhibition task reflects the examinee&#8217;s ability to inhibit the more
                salient, automatic task of reading words in order to name the dissonant ink
                colors quickly. Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s performance on this subtest was in the 37th
                percentile. Finally, successful performance on the difficult Inhibition/Switching
                task requires adequate naming speed, reading speed, verbal inhibition, and
                cognitive flexibility. Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s performance on this subtest was in the 25th
                percentile.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraphs"> On the Motor Coordination subtest from the Beery VMI, Mr. XXXXXperformed
                in the 50th percentile suggesting average fine motor abilities.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraphs"> Mr. XXXXX&#8217;s weak left hemisphere functioning, weak verbal reasoning abilities,
                poor mental control, low verbal memory scores, slow processing speed, and deficits in
                executive functions correspond with his self-report of cognitive changes following his
                accident. These results are positive evidence for the presence of a traumatic brain
                injury.
