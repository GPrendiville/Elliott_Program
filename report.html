                All of the Part I subtests Orientation, Presidential Memory, Naming, Comprehension,
                and Constructive Praxis - are mainly related to more conventional types of

                tasks contained in the Part II subtests - Shifting Set, Incomplete Pictures,
                Similarities, Attention, and Working Memory. These subtests are aimed at the
                processing of novel, incomplete, and less conventional types of information -
                the kind of processing required for the successful performance of executive

            <p class="paragraphs"> <span class="title">TITLE</span> <span class="lname">LAST</span> was administered the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) which is

                <span class="pronoun">PRONOUN</span> responses while generating words as quickly as possible. Skills necessary for this task include initiation, simultaneous processing, 
                systematic retrieval of phonemically similar lexical items, and processing speed. Performance also depends on several fundamental 
                cognitive components, including vocabulary knowledge, spelling ability, and attention. <span class="title">TITLE</span> <span class="lname">LAST</span>&#8217;s

                Category Fluency required xxxx to retrieve multiple words from a high-frequency semantic category. 
                If semantic knowledge is intact, then the retrieval of words from an overlearned semantic category usually requires less effort than 
                does the retrieval of words that start with a particular sound, which usually requires more effortful processing due, in large part, 
                to the novelty of the endeavor.  <span class="title">TITLE</span> <span class="lname">LAST</span>&#8217;s performance on this subtest was in the

                As with Color Naming, this condition can serve as a baseline measure for purposes of measuring  basic reading speed. 
                <span class="title">TITLE</span> <span class="lname">LAST</span>&#8217;s performance on this subtest was in the <span  class="wordreading">ERROR</span>% which 
                indicates <span  class="wordReadingString">ERROR</span>. The time taken to complete the
