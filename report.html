                    All of the Part I subtests Orientation, Presidential Memory, Naming, Comprehension,
                    and Constructive Praxis - are mainly related to more conventional types of

                    tasks contained in the Part II subtests - Shifting Set, Incomplete Pictures,
                    Similarities, Attention, and Working Memory. These subtests are aimed at the
                    processing of novel, incomplete, and less conventional types of information -
                    the kind of processing required for the successful performance of executive functions.
